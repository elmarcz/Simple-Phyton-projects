# Simple-Phyton-Projects
These projects are for those who want to get started in Phyton. Here you will find some of the most famous projects to start programming in Phyton. 

# Arithmetical Operators
Arithmetic operators are the simplest of all, they are used to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus and exponential.

# Data types
In computer science, a computer data type, or simply type, is an attribute of data that tells the computer what kind of data it will handle. This includes imposing restrictions on the data, such as what values it can take and what operations it can perform. 
- [Code](https://github.com/elmarcz/Data-types-in-Python/blob/main/README.md)

# Logical operators
Logical operations are mathematical expressions whose result is a Boolean value (true or false, in PHP, true or false). These expressions are mainly used in control structures. 
- [Code](https://github.com/elmarcz/Simple-Phyton-projects/blob/main/Content/Logical%20operations.md)

# Multiple conditional statements
The multiple conditional statement allows us to choose a route from among several possible routes, based on the value of a variable that acts as a selector. 
- [Code](https://github.com/elmarcz/Simple-Phyton-projects/blob/main/Content/elif.py)

# Relational operators
When using relational operators within a conditional statement, if the result of the comparison is correct, the expression or condition is considered true. Otherwise it is considered false.

# Data Input For Keyboard
In Phyton, keyboard input is widely used to perform operations, modify variables, repeat processes, etc.
